**2.Brief explanation of how the conflict was resolved**

Both branches changed the same file i.e. index.html in different ways, the feature branch added the styling (css style) and updated the paragraph. The add-content branch updated the paragraph with different content. When merging with the main branch initially the when feature branch got merged it didn't show any conflict, but when add-content got merged it showed conflict because both modified the same section. Hence I manually resolved the conflict, then saved the file.
